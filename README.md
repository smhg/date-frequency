frequency
===========
> Temporal frequency library

## Example
```javascript
var frequency = new Frequency();

frequency.on('hour', 10)
  .on('minute', 30)
  .between(new Date(2013, 8, 2), new Date(2013, 8, 8, 23, 59));

/*
  returns an array with these dates:
  2013-09-02 10:30:00
  2013-09-03 10:30:00
  2013-09-04 10:30:00
  2013-09-05 10:30:00
  2013-09-06 10:30:00
  2013-09-07 10:30:00
  2013-09-08 10:30:00
  */
```

## Methods
### Frequency()
Constructor takes a string notation (also see `toString()`).
```javascript
var frequency = Frequency('F3D/WT10H30M'); // every 3rd day of the week (Wednesday) at 10:30:00
```

### .on(unit, fix, [of])
Add frequency rules by specifying a unit and a value to fix it to.
All units below the specified unit get fixed to the default (their value at the Unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00).
The optional `of` parameter allows you to change the scope of the unit. By default each unit's scope is the unit above it in a regular date.
```javascript
frequency.on('hour', 10); // sets the frequency to each day at 10:00:00
frequency.on('day', 6).on('hour', 10).on('minute', 30); // sets the frequency to the 6th day of each month at 12:30:00
frequency.on('day', 7, 'week'); // sets the frequency to Sundays at 00:00:00
```

### .next(date)
Returns the next occurence of the frequency after the specified date.

### .between(start, end)
Returns all occurences of the frequency between (and including) the specified start and end date.

### .toString()
Returns a string notation of the frequency (useful for storage).

## Todo
* Add filters
  * odd/even (compared to reference date, e.g. Unix epoch)
  * *n*th ocurrence within scope (e.g. 2nd Thursday of the month)
* Remove dependencies

## Development
* Install latest [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) version.
* `git clone https://github.com/smhg/date-frequency-js.git` to fetch source.
* `npm install` to install dependencies.
* `npm test` to run tests.
